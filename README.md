# 🚦 QueueLess – Smart Token Management System


Demo Link: http://56.228.22.148:3000

QueueLess is a modern **digital token and queue management platform** built to eliminate physical waiting lines in places like **clinics, hospitals, service centers, and offices**.  
It allows users to join queues online, get real-time updates about their turn, and enables admins (such as doctors) to efficiently manage daily tokens.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In real-world service environments:
- People wait **physically for long hours**
- There is **no visibility** on the current token being served
- Manual token systems lead to **confusion and inefficiency**

---

## 💡 Solution

QueueLess digitizes the entire token workflow:
- Users join queues **remotely**
- Live updates show which token is currently active
- Users are notified when **their turn is approaching**
- Admins have full control over queue progression

This significantly reduces overcrowding and improves service efficiency.
